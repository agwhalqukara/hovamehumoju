Of course, the exact time frame is up for debate, but, depending on which historian you ask, Roman rule dates as far back as circa 750 B.C.E. and ran up until somewhere in the latter half of the fifth century C.E. No matter how you cut it, that's a staggeringly large chunk of human history.
With that in mind, it should be no surprise that the era of Julius Caesar and Marcus Aurelius has had a major, permeating effect on society as we know it.</description></item><item><title>Cuntos das faltan para que termine el ao?</title><link>/cu%C3%A1ntos-d%C3%ADas-faltan-para-que-termine-el-a%C3%B1o.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/cu%C3%A1ntos-d%C3%ADas-faltan-para-que-termine-el-a%C3%B1o.html</guid><description>Faltan 201 días para Año Nuevo!.
