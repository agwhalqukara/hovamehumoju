If yes, then stay with us for a while as we are about to bring you closer to this prominent racer.</p><h2><span id=Kye_Kelley_Bio_Early_Life_Parents_and_Education>Kye Kelley Bio: Early Life, Parents, and Education</span></h2><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kye Kelley Racing</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Saturday, November 10, 2018</a></p><p>The son of Tammy and Kyle Kelley I, he grew up on the family farm in Magnolia with his younger sister, Lacey Howell. From an early age he became interested in cars and in order to make his dream come true of owning a car, he found two jobs when he was still only 13 years old, milking cows on nearby farms and working in a grocery store on as a bagger, meantime attending South Pike Senior High School. He fulfilled his dream just two years after finding his first job, then obtaining his driving license, and his racing career was ready to start.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>Before he made a name for himself as a racer, Kye worked in an oil refinery company; staring as a simple “Fire Watcher”, he eventually reached the position of superintendent, and 250 people were answering to him. It took him ten years to become a superintendent, but only a few years to quit the job and focus on his own business, opening the car shop named Down South Performance, with his business partner Greg Champagne, with headquarters in McComb, Mississippi.</p><h2><span id=Street_Racer>Street Racer</span></h2><p></p><p>His first car was his friends 1965 Chevy II Nova, but then he bought his first car at the age of 15, and would travel to Mississippi or New Orleans for Da Pad drag racing. In his first race, Kye not only won the race, but also set the record, which earned him the title of being the fastest person around. As his skills improved and his popularity grew, he was noticed by a number of important figures from street racing, including Just Shearer a.k.a Big Chief, who was looking for the fastest man around New Orleans, and everybody pinpointed Key. As a result, Kye was recruited by Big Chief and was ready to race against big names such as Daddy Dave, and others. In his <a rel=nofollow href=#>first race against Daddy Dave</a>, Kye lost by a close margin, but got his revenge later as he left Daddy Dave behind in their second race.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Prominence>Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr><a rel=nofollow href=#>#KyeKelley</a> is just insane enough to call out his GIRLFRIEND on the track tonight.

In 2015 he had the chance to compete against 14-time world champion racer Mike Murillo at Thunder Valley Raceway Park in Lexington, Oklahoma, and won the race, but his victory was overruled as it was determined that Key left the start line before the order.</p><h2><span id=Kye_Kelley_Net_Worth>Kye Kelley Net Worth</span></h2><p>Since launching his career and struggling in the beginning, thanks to his wins that have earned him thousands of dollars, his net worth has increased steadily.
