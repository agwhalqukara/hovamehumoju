The rapper was poking fun at his baby momma, including one point in the video where he asked his young child what his mother was up to.</p><p>Blueface’s baby momma did damage to his property on a number of fronts, including the keying of his cars and smashing a few windows in the process. According to Hot New Hip Hop, Blueface rose exponentially in the rap game but hasn’t seen his career extend beyond that point.</p><p>Regardless, one thing for is sure, and that’s that Blueface knows how to generate baby momma drama online. On his social media account, many fans in the comment section were not impressed with his antics.</p><p>People were asking why he would let his young child see such violent and off-the-wall behavior. In case you missed it, Babyface uploaded a video in which the mother of his child, Jaidyn Alexis, took a metal scooper to one of his cars.</p><p>Jaidyn also stomped all over his cars and left massive footprints on his vehicles. You can check out one of these Instagram posts below:</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CALGnF2A9hU/</p><p>Blueface isn’t the only rapper to be atop of the entertainment media headlines over the last few months. Tekashi 6ix9ine, following his release from a federal penitentiary, came back home and uploaded a record-breaking Instagram Live in which he beat Tory Lanez’s previous benchmark.</p><p>Furthermore, his baby momma, Sara Molina, told her followers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to simply ignore Tekashi 6ix9ine because all he wants is attention.</a> Not that long after, Sara Molina was spotted hanging out with Rich the Kid, and reports claimed they were filming a music video together.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Another star in the rap game to face his own baby momma dilemma is Rick Ross, who’s currently being forced by a court of law to take a paternity test to make sure his two children actually belong to him. The idea behind the test is to guarantee his fatherhood and also get child support payments.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeilr2xsdFmmaWtlZuupLGMrJ%2Bor6NivKeyjK2fnmWUlrqis8Rmm6imlWKvunnHoqpmmpGXxm65zqakmmWWp7Kit86uq2ZraWyAd4SO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frapper-blueface-shows-off-the-damage-done-by-his-baby-momma-freakout.html&text=Rapper%20Blueface%20Shows%20Off%20The%20Damage%20Done%20By%20His%20Baby%20Momma%20Freakout&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frapper-blueface-shows-off-the-damage-done-by-his-baby-momma-freakout.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frapper-blueface-shows-off-the-damage-done-by-his-baby-momma-freakout.html&title=Rapper%20Blueface%20Shows%20Off%20The%20Damage%20Done%20By%20His%20Baby%20Momma%20Freakout" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frapper-blueface-shows-off-the-damage-done-by-his-baby-momma-freakout.html&title=Rapper%20Blueface%20Shows%20Off%20The%20Damage%20Done%20By%20His%20Baby%20Momma%20Freakout" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frapper-blueface-shows-off-the-damage-done-by-his-baby-momma-freakout.html&title=Rapper%20Blueface%20Shows%20Off%20The%20Damage%20Done%20By%20His%20Baby%20Momma%20Freakout" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frapper-blueface-shows-off-the-damage-done-by-his-baby-momma-freakout.html&description=Rapper%20Blueface%20Shows%20Off%20The%20Damage%20Done%20By%20His%20Baby%20Momma%20Freakout" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./27-facts-about-ancient-rome-that-are-eerily-relevant-today-best-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="27 Facts About Ancient Rome That Are Eerily Relevant Today  Best Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pimped-out-suzuki-jimny-brabus-gives-hope-to-everyone-who-dreams-of-owning-a-g-wagon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pimped Out Suzuki Jimny Brabus Gives Hope to Everyone Who Dreams of Owning a G Wagon">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
