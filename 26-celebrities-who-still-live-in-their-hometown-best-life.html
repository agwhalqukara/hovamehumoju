And for those that do, it makes sense: they are the undisputed hubs of the entertainment industry in the U.S. But for some stars, the siren song of nightly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>red carpets</a> and Beverly Hills infinity pools doesn't quite do the trick. Instead, something a bit more humble has appeal. More celebrities than you think still live in their hometown.</p><p>Whether they moved back after scoring big or simply never left in the first place, a select crop of famous folks live right in the places where they grew up (albeit in way fancier digs). We're talking places like Kentwood, Louisiana; Leiper's Fork, Tennessee; and Yellow Springs, Ohio—all towns far removed from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. So read on—you just might find that your favorite celeb lives right next door.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The 14 Celebrities Who Have the Most Kids</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Bruce-Springsteen.jpg><p>Few stars are as heavily associated with their home state as&nbsp;<strong>Bruce Springsteen&nbsp;</strong>is with New Jersey. The Boss grew up in Freehold, NJ, and as most of his music will tell you, he was never likely to roam too far. He and his wife <strong>Patty Scialfa&nbsp;</strong>reside <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on a horse farm in Colts Neck</a>, which is in the same county as the house where the star grew up. And investing in horses definitely paid off—their daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Jessica Springsteen</strong>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>an Olympic equestrian</a> who competed in the last Olympic games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/shutterstock_103572509.jpg><p>Born in New Orleans, <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong> was raised in Nashville, Tennessee by her physician parents. When it came time to spend some of her hard-earned acting money on real estate, she went back to her roots—purchasing <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>three homes in the Nashville</a> area with her husband, Jim Toth. Currently, they split their time between there and another mansion in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/JustinTimberlake.jpg><p>After years in Los Angeles,&nbsp;<strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> moved back to his roots in 2016, purchasing a home in Tennessee and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>naming it "Millville"</a> in honor of his childhood suburb of Millington, Tennessee. Despite its humble location, the abode also serves as the creative HQ for the artist's clothing line and artist development company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Ludacris.jpg><p>Rapper and&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Ludacris&nbsp;</strong>has called a lot of places home. He was born in Champaign, Illinois, then spent parts of his childhood in Chicago and Virginia. For his last years of high school, his family was in Atlanta, Georgia, and the star ended up going to college and beginning to make music there too. As an adult, Ludacris has chosen to put down roots where he spent some of his most formative years and lives on a 22-acre estate in Atlanta. And if it's difficult to conceptualize just how big that is, consider that Ludacris said during a recent appearance on Ellen&nbsp;that he hadn't even&nbsp;seen&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>certain parts of his home</a> until he was stuck there during lockdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/dave-chappelle.jpg><p><strong>Dave Chappelle</strong> grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., but he often spent summers in the sleepy town of Yellow Springs, Ohio, and went to middle school there, too. <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>His father was a professor</a> at the nearby Antioch University. As an adult, the comedian moved back to town, purchasing a farm there as a refuge from the hectic Hollywood lifestyle.
