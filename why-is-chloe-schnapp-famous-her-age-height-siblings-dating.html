She’s active on various social media networks, and launched her YouTube channel on 4 July 2021, which is today subscribed to by close to 2,000 people; Chloe’s posted 25 videos and all of these together number more than 130,000 views. Most of Chloe’s videos feature her spending time with her family, singing karaoke, and taking on some of the most popular internet challenges.</p><p>She’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>also known for</a> being the twin sister of Noah Schnapp, a popular American actor ,perhaps known best for starring as Will Byers in all 41 episodes of the critically acclaimed fantasy horror series “Stranger Things”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/7a1a614e33223bfdda3c619ad3045ebc.jpg><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Chloe was raised in Scarsdale alongside Noah, by their father Mitchell Schnapp and mother Karine (nee Perez); the family’s Jewish and Chloe and Noah travelled to Israel to have their bar mitzvah. Karine’s of Moroccan descent and works at Hugo Boss as the president of marketing, and Mitchell’s of Russian descent and is a private equity manager.</p><p>Chloe studied at a local high school together with her brother and when he joined the school’s drama club, she followed in his footsteps; she was eight when her brother was advised by his teacher to pursue a career as an actor, and even though Chloe wanted to try it as well, she soon learned that she wasn’t talented enough. She remained supportive of her brother and encouraged him to go to auditions.</p><p>Chloe instead <a rel=nofollow href=#>focused on dancing</a>, and went on to take lessons for a couple of years. She’s matriculated just recently in 2023, and because she’s yet to talk about her further education, it’s widely believed that Chloe’s chosen not to attend college.</p><h2><span id=Most_viewed_YouTube_videos>Most viewed YouTube videos</span></h2><p>Chloe seems to be mostly popular on YouTube for the short videos in which she can be seen spending time with her brother Noah, although her fans also like her for taking on internet challenges, her dance moves and pretty face. We’ll be writing about Chloe’s three most seen videos as these have led a number of people to subscribe to her channel.</p><p>Her #1 video “Chloe VS Noah Schnapp TikTok, who does it better?” has been viewed over 13,000 times since 4 July 2021 and has amassed nearly 750 likes; it features Chloe and Noah dancing to the same song to see who’s doing it better.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Her second most popular video “Chloe Schnapp’s world | Noah Schnapp college’s acceptance” has been watched nearly 9,000 times since 16 July 2022 and has amassed over 600 likes, while it features the Schnapp family celebrating that Noah was accepted at college.</p><p>Chloe’s #3 video “TikTok – Chloe and Noah Schnapp Elevator Challenge” has been watched more than 8,200 times since 15 March 2022, and has amassed over 540 likes; it features Chloe and Noah taking on the internet’s elevator challenge.</p><h2><span id=Presence_on_social_media_networks>Presence on social media networks</span></h2><p>Chloe’s active on various social media networks and these seem to be her only source of income.</p><p>Close to a million people are following her on Instagram today and she’s posted over 70 pictures and videos, with most showing her spending time with her best friends from school, dressing up for Halloween, and relaxing at the beach.</p><p>Chloe’s tweeted 16 times since the creation of her Twitter account in August 2016, however, she’s followed by only three people on the network and her account’s recently been locked for unknown reasons.</p><p>She’s quite popular on TikTok too,as nearly three million people are following her on the network, with all her videos together numbering over 45 million likes; most feature her spending time with her friends, lip syncing to her favorite songs and dancing.</p><p>Chloe has a Facebook profile, too, but only uses this social media network to stay in touch with her real life friends and family members, thus not allowing her fans to interact with her on Facebook.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_boyfriend>Love life and boyfriend</span></h2><p>Chloe prefers to keep the details of her love life to herself and although most of her fans believe that she’s currently single and prefers to focus on her career on the internet, there are also those who believe otherwise.</p><p>Some of her fans have claimed that she’s in a relationship with a boy whom she met in February 2023 at school; it was in February that they apparently saw the two spending time together for the first time, but as Chloe hasn’t addressed these rumors nor featured the boy in any of her internet content, this remains unconfirmed.</p><p>There are also those who claim that she might be attracted to girls, and is in a relationship with the girl whom she occasionally features in her Instagram pictures, but this hasn’t been confirmed either.</p><p>Chloe <a rel=nofollow href=#>seems to be single</a> as of December 2023, hasn’t married and doesn’t have children.</p><h2><span id=Interesting_facts_and_hobbies>Interesting facts and hobbies</span></h2><p>Chloe still today occasionally practices dancing together with her friends, and sometimes shows off her moves in her TikTok videos.</p><p>She’s a fashionista, and goes shopping for clothes several times every week; Chloe’s favorite ‘colors’ are black and white.</p><p>She likes to dress up, and thus Halloween’s her favorite holiday, with her second favorite being Christmas.</p><p>Chloe’s into travelling and has been to a couple of US states, mostly to keep her brother company while he’s shooting for his movies and TV series; it’s believed that Chloe’s yet to travel overseas.</p><p>She likes to eat fruits, and her favorites are blueberries and raspberries.</p><p>One of Chloe’s favorite singers is Katy Perry.</p><p>One of her favorite actors and comedians is Adam Sandler, and a couple of Chloe’s favorite movies are “Hubie Halloween”, “Murder Mystery” and “The Week Of”.</p><h2><span id=Age_height_and_net_worth>Age, height and net worth</span></h2><p>Chloe’s age is 19.
