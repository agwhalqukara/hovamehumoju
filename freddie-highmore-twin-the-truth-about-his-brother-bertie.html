He is known for his versatile and charming performances, as well as his impressive academic achievements. But did you know that he has a brother who looks very much like him? Many people have wondered if Freddie Highmore has a twin brother, and the answer is no. However, he does have a younger brother named Bertie Highmore, who is also an actor and a successful businessman. Here are some facts about Freddie Highmore’s brother Bertie that you may not know.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bertie Highmore’s Early Life and Education</h3><p>Bertie Highmore was born in 1995 in London, England, as Albert Samuel Highmore. He is the son of Sue Latimer, a talent agent who represents actors like Daniel Radcliffe and Imelda Staunton, and Edward Highmore, a former actor who appeared in shows like Doctor Who and Howards’ Way. Bertie grew up in London with his parents and his older brother Freddie, who was born in 1992.</p><p>Bertie attended Highgate School, an independent school in London, where he excelled in academics. He then graduated from The London School of Economics and Political Science with a BSc in Management degree in Finance. He also studied Arabic and Spanish at Cambridge University’s Emmanuel College, where his brother Freddie also earned a double first degree in the same languages.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bertie Highmore’s Acting Career</h3><p>Bertie Highmore made his acting debut in 1999, when he was only four years old. He appeared in the comedy movie Women Talking Dirty alongside his brother Freddie, who was seven at the time. They played the sons of Helena Bonham Carter’s character, who had a complicated relationship with her French lover. The movie was based on a novel by Isla Dewar and directed by Coky Giedroyc.</p><p>Bertie did not pursue acting further after his first movie role, unlike his brother Freddie, who went on to star in many blockbuster films and critically acclaimed TV shows. Bertie preferred to focus on his education and his business career instead. However, he did support his brother’s acting endeavors and attended some of his movie premieres and award ceremonies.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bertie Highmore’s Business Career</h3><p>Bertie Highmore is currently a principal at Blue Wire Capital Limited, a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage technology companies across Europe and Asia. He joined the firm in 2019 and has been involved in several deals and projects since then. He is also an advisor at Creator Fund since 2021, a venture capital fund that supports student entrepreneurs across Europe.</p><p>Bertie has also worked as an intern at Gulf Bank in Kuwait in 2012 and at a law firm in Madrid during his year abroad while studying at Cambridge University. He has also attended summer school at the London School of Economics to learn more about finance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bertie Highmore’s Personal Life</h3><p>Bertie Highmore is very private about his personal life and does not have any social media accounts. He rarely gives interviews or makes public appearances. He likes to keep a low profile and avoid the spotlight that his brother Freddie often faces. However, he is close to his family and friends and enjoys traveling and learning new languages.</p><p>Bertie Highmore is not married and does not have any children. He is also not dating anyone publicly at the moment. His brother Freddie, on the other hand, is married to Klarissa Munz since 2021, according to Leedaily<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>1</a>. She is a German actress who met Freddie while they were both studying at Cambridge University.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h3><p>Freddie Highmore and Bertie Highmore are not twins, but they are brothers who share a lot of similarities. They both have a passion for languages, education, and acting. They both have successful careers in their respective fields. They both have supportive parents and a strong bond with each other. They are both talented and handsome young men who have made their mark in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX5u%2FprDDopxmoJmcta670Z5kra%2BZo3q1tMRmq6utpJ16oq7OrqtmoJmoeqO%2Bzq2fnqpdl7KzwMieZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffreddie-highmore-twin-the-truth-about-his-brother-bertie.html&text=Freddie%20Highmore%20Twin%3a%20The%20Truth%20About%20His%20Brother%20Bertie&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreddie-highmore-twin-the-truth-about-his-brother-bertie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreddie-highmore-twin-the-truth-about-his-brother-bertie.html&title=Freddie%20Highmore%20Twin%3a%20The%20Truth%20About%20His%20Brother%20Bertie" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffreddie-highmore-twin-the-truth-about-his-brother-bertie.html&title=Freddie%20Highmore%20Twin%3a%20The%20Truth%20About%20His%20Brother%20Bertie" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffreddie-highmore-twin-the-truth-about-his-brother-bertie.html&title=Freddie%20Highmore%20Twin%3a%20The%20Truth%20About%20His%20Brother%20Bertie" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreddie-highmore-twin-the-truth-about-his-brother-bertie.html&description=Freddie%20Highmore%20Twin%3a%20The%20Truth%20About%20His%20Brother%20Bertie" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lucinda-southworth-larry-page-s-wife-age-spouse-education-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lucinda Southworth, Larry Page's wife: age, spouse, education, net worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fantasy-plays-players-to-start-and-sit-for-nfl-week-16.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fantasy plays: Players to start and sit for NFL Week 16">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
